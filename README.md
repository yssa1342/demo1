# Wallpaper Gallery

This is a simple static wallpaper website inspired by [haowallpaper.com](https://haowallpaper.com).

## Features
- Category navigation
- Wallpaper grid with preview
- Download links for each wallpaper

## Usage
Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. The page loads wallpaper data from `wallpapers.json` and displays it dynamically with JavaScript.

## Development
The project uses only static assets, so no build step is required. To run a quick local server for development, you can use:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.
